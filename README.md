# Hospital Readmissions
*A machine learning project modeling hospital re-admission rates.*

## Overview:
Diabetes has a significant impact on the American healthcare system, both in terms of patient health as well as the cost of care. One key component of improving outcomes is identifying patients that could benefit for intervention just after a hospitalization, in order to prevent early hospital readmission. In this project, we utilized a de-identified patient dataset ([sourced from here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24804245/)) of diabetic patients in the US, in order to build a machine learning model of early hospital readmissions in this population. This repo contains code for exploratory data analysis, visualization, model building, and cost analysis for the project.

## Contents of this repo.

  -Data_Preprocessing.ipynb: Notebook to limit analysis to the first patient encounter, and remove patients that died or were discharged to hospice during the encounter. 
  -Preproc_FeatEng.ipynb: Feature engineering on diagnosis codes and drugs prescribed, as well as binarization of the target variable.
  
Ava, Yi, and Matt: Individual notebooks for model development.
